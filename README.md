# ComplexAutomatonBase
Minimalistic Framework for Complex Automata

More information coming soon.

## About

The **C**omplex **A**utomaton **B**ase offers a framework for rapidly prototyping agent-based simulations. These simulations usually take place in a grid-like world which is made up of square or hexagonal cells. Systems that involve a large number of cooperating individuals are commonplace in the natural world, like ant or bee colonies and flocks of birds or swarms of fish.

## Installation

Use the shell scripts to pack and install the CA Framework.
Optionally run 1_pack_dist.sh to create a distributable package or use the .tar.gz file in the dist dist subfolder.
Then run 2_install_dist.sh to install the library into your local python directory.

Import ComplexAutomatonBase in your scripts by using "import cab"

To remove, execute 3_uninst_dist_solus.sh or 3_uninst_dist_ubuntu.sh, depending on your operating system.
This will be changed in the future to make the install and uninstall process distro agnostic.

## Usage

Coming soon.
